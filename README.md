# Individual in-situ GPS-derived acceleration-speed profiling

## Introduction

This project accompanies the research paper titled [*Individual in-situ GPS-derived acceleration-speed profiling: towards automatization and refinement*](https://dx.doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-3251516/v1) under-reviewed in the journal *Sports Medecine-Open* by [N. Miguens](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathan-miguens-543118176/).

## Overview

Recently a [proof-of-concept]((https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiomech.2021.110524)) was proposed to derive the soccer playersâ€™ individual in-situ acceleration-speed (AS) profile from global positioning system (GPS) data collected over several sessions. The present study aimed to validate an automatized method of individual GPS-derived in-situ AS profiling in professional rugby union setting.

## Project Contents

1. **/data**: This directory contains a dataset for testing the code and providing an example of the expected file. 

2. **/code**: This directory contains the source code associated with the research. The code is divided into separate modules for easier understanding: *outliers* to identify outliers and *regression* to calculate AV profiles.

3. **/results**: This directory contains the results produced by the code: a csv file containing the characteristic values of the AV profiles by player and possibly by training exercise; point cloud images for each player and training exercise.

## Requirements

Python 3 is required to run the code for this project.
