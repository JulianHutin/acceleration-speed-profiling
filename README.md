# acceleration-speed-profiling
Recently a proof-of-concept was proposed to derive the soccer playersâ€™ individual in-situ acceleration-speed (AS) profile from global positioning system (GPS) data collected over several sessions. The present study aimed to validate an automatized method of individual GPS-derived in-situ AS profiling in professional rugby union setting.
